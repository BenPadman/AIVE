This text file has information that may be useful when running AIVE.

AIVE, or AI directed voxel extraction, is an image processing technique for working
with FIB-SEM image datasets. It primarily involves an image calculation requiring
3 key images.

The original image is used to create 3 stacks:
Source image (original image with some pre-processing)
AI membrane prediction result
Regions of Interest (ROIs) segmentations

These three image stacks are all that is needed for running the AIVE merge
calculations. All three images need to be tif stacks.

The AIVE output may also be post processed to determine volumetric calculations,
or further processed for import into downstream software, such as 3D environments.

We provide a pipeline here to generate the three images required, however, this
is just a suggestion for one way to achieve these images. You may ultimately
choose to optimise or modify these method to your own data. For this reason the
code for this plugin is left open.

Alternatively you may choose a different approach from those suggested.
For example, here we have the basic pipeline for training a reproducible and
documentable random forest model. However, you may choose to train a different
type of AI model. The only thing you will need to confirm is that your AI output
is saved as a .tif image, preferably in 32-bit, where the gray values correspond 
to the probability values between 0 and 1.
